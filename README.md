# project

  This project is part of the Wireless and Mobile Computing course and aims to develop a user-friendly weather application utilizing the Flutter architecture and Dart programming language that provides accurate and up-to-date daily weather forecasts, air quality data, and location-specific weather maps. The app contains a search tool that allows users to look for weather and air quality data for specific places. This project's main objective is to overcome the shortcomings of existing weather apps by delivering accurate and trustworthy data that enables users to make informed daily decisions. The anticipated benefit of the weather app is to provide users with a simple and trustworthy source of weather information, as well as a seamless and pleasurable user experience.
